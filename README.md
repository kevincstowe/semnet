SemNet resource
---
SemNet is a resource that contains semantic components for verbs. These include VerbNet, FrameNet, and OntoNotes features, distributional properties from corpora, definitions, and sense-specific word embeddings.

SemNet is currently in json format, keyed by verbs. Each verb contains a list of VerbNet classes, and these are then linked to further features.
